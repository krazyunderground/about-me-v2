# More about me
### **Where it all began**
According to my parents ever since I was a baby I've always loved things with buttons <br />
Like most people, my first programming language was scratch, and I believe that its the best place to start as a child. <br />
This was truly the catalyst for my insane obsession for computers, and partially what lead me to where I am today. <br />

### **My past on Discord (And Discord Bots)**
About 3-4 years ago now when I was 13, I picked up Javascript because I wanted to make a Discord Bot. In particular I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeLyon"><strong>Codelyon's tutorials.</strong></a> <br />
I used what I'd learnt to make a bot in the server for the (at the time) instagram-shitposter mini-celeb known as **Mank Demes** (I dont think the server or the instagram exists)<br />
Unfortunately, as of writing this (03/12/2022) the **CodeLyon** channel is dead, and Alesh has told me personally that he will not bring the channel back. <br />
Nevertheless I am actually a head mod of his discord server, because I became so integrated with the community and at the time I always did code help. <br />
It was in my time of helping here I met one of my colleagues, Saoul. At one point, the code helpers wanted to make a Coding Jam amongst ourselves. <br />
So I set out to make my bot in that fixed amount of time, with the knowledge that I had accrued over time. **This was the birth of my first public bot, <a href="https://github.com/krazyunderground/michiru"><strong>Michiru.</strong></a>** <br /><br />
To put it bluntly, the bot was shit. This is where Saoul comes in. He saw my horrible spaghetti code and cheap quick.db methods, and helped me make the bot better. <br />
Over the course of about 6 months we made huge improvements, and the bot had found its way into up to 60 servers (cant remember the accurate number) <br />
It was around this time I decided to discontinue **Michiru**, since i needed to focus on my schoolwork, and i couldnt guarantee constant development or hosting like before. <br />
I went on a very long hiatus, of which Saoul (and my boss in the codelyon server, Scarl3t) approached me with some jobs for Scarl3t with Saoul. <br />
*not sure how much of this part story I can (or should) tell, so ill gloss over it:* basically nobody wanted to work and all the projects stopped. <br />
I worked on and off with projects of my own, but nothing too substancial for me to mention here.

### **What im doing now**
At of lately, I'm still working on projects on and off of my own, but I am the co-owner and developer for the <a href="https://discord.gg/hazbinhotel"><strong>Voxcord server.</strong></a> <br />
As of this minute, I am working on a public rewrite of the bot for **Voxcord**, **Voxnet**, and the very page you are looking at now. <br />
In the future, Im considering opening Discord Bot commissions if I get enough traction (Shoot me a **DM** or **email** if you're interested).
