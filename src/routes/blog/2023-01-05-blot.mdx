  Covering the change from Voxnet to Blot, plus why I've made no progress <br />
</div>

### What's happened with Voxnet/Blot?
For ease of avoiding any legal issues, we have opted to use a character that is already owned by us and can be used without any consequence, which is why we are using blot.
The rewrite hasn't been released, because truthfully I havent done any work on the bot since before, I haven't had as much motivation to code as before, so nothing's been done ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### GCSEs in the way
My GCSEs are coming up in ~11 weeks, meaning that i've been making more of an effort towards them, and as a consequence a lot of the freetime I may have had before is now taken
up by revision. 

### Sidenote: Wavy Background
I thought that the block colour background was too bland, so I added *waves*, sooo *wavy*

So long and farewell, Krazy
