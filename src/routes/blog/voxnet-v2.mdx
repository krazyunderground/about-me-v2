  This post is about all the updates coming in the rewrite of the bot <strong>Voxnet</strong>. <br />
  I'll cover what's different, why I plan, and what my plans are for the future. (I will be making this the standard format)<br />
</div>

### What I plan to be changed:

Due to demand, I've decided to take the bot public. *however* this does mean we will be saying **goodbye** to a few features. This includes:

- AI chat (more on that later)
- Randomly sending balls in chat (yes, this is a feature)
- Music command (YT support)

**Some features that are being added are:**

- Admin settings (cant pester me anymore)
- Moderation tools
- Games & Economy

**And lastly, some wanted features that are in planning:**

- **Dashboard** website

All of these things are goals that I may set myself in the future

### Why I plan to update:
Really, its because of 2 things. Allowing people to use the bot themselves (obviously) and **legal issues**. <br />
You see, the people up at **youtube** have already taken down some of the largest bots on Discord, meaning I'm not taking any chances if this goes big (**I cant afford a lawyer**). <br />
The same also applies to the AI. At the minute, I'm *technically* using an unofficial package for **cleverbot**. The reason why, in short: **AI costs _money_, and I am not _paid_**. <br />

This conviniently takes me to another point, when it comes to the bot, I am currently running it out of the kindness of my own heart, and the **deepness of my own pockets.**<br />
Fortunately for me, the hosting itself is cheap since I do it myself, but any added features people may want will be expensive. This is why I have devised of two options for funding APIs and services

1. I have a **premium service** for the bot (you get what you pay for)
2. I rely on **donations** from other people (Everybody benefits, but at a risk)

While this might outrage some, and ring alarm bells for others, I really dont have a say or choice in the matter. If these features are what people want, then the money has to come in somehow. <br />
At some point I may hold a poll to see what people want to do about this issue, but for now you can voice your opinions in my **DM**s.

### What I have planned for the future:
I've already **attempted** to ask **Vivienne** for the permission to use the character for branding, so hopefully that goes through well. <br />
But for the minute, I dont have anything else I need to do. The features are in the works, legal issues are being ironed out, and all is **good**. <br /><br />
So long and farewell, Krazy
