  This short article is about my new website built with <strong>SolidJS</strong>. <br />
  I'll cover what's different, why I upgraded, and what my plans are for the future. <br />
</div>

### What's changed?
Well first off, the library used to code the website is different. <br /> Before i used Astro, which is a Javascript framework based on speed and cross compatability. <br /> While it was easy to use and i learnt a lot from the experience, I thought i'd try something different. <br /> Of course a few obvious changes include:

- Multi-page system
- *Awesome* new blogpost system
- Server side rendering
- Full page hydration
- Markdown compatability
- *very* minimalist style

And while some of it is boring, some of it is also very needed. <br /> Even with most of the pages, its all written in MDX - Meaning I barely wrote any code!

### Why did you upgrade?

For me, I like to challenge myself by creating new projects all the time. <br /> Although most of them I dont finish, I enjoy using different libraries and frameworks to learn because it helps me generalise the skills i've learnt, and apply them to any problem or programming language that I may encounter. <br /> Not to mention, the previous website was very basic, so I thought it could do with a little bit of a rewrite. <br />

### What are your plans for the future?

When it comes to this about me page, its supposed to only be a portfolio for people who are interested in my work, and a little "hey, I exist!" for others. <br /> In that regard - although it may have a few facelifts - fundementally I believe it will stay the same from now on. <br /> However, when it comes to other projects like potentially some Discord bot dashboards, I may lean towards new frameworks to broaden my horizons. <br /> <br /><br />

### Additional notes:

Not that I believe anybody cares, but from now on any coding projects that I work on publicly I will make progress updates and so forth on this page.<br /><br />
So long and farewell, Krazy
